## <div align="center">Description</div>

This is a practice repo. The purpose is to test out new concepts and try new things that I'm learning.

So far we've been working on HTML and CSS. Next we're going to add in some JavaScript to learn more about functions, arrays, objects, for loops, prompts, and much, much more.
